Onest
In seven fonts, from thin to extra bold, Onest is designed as a hybrid of geometric and humanistic grotesques. Onest is suitable for reading long texts from the screens of any device and is recommended for    apps and sites. Letters are easily distinguished even in small sizes, so they can be used in interface elements or navigation. Several character sets have been developed for a range of closed and semi-closed apertures, allowing the combination of characters depending on the goal. Onest is a modern typeface, so it has a lot of useful conveniences. The subtleties of correct speech transmission are Onest's strong points. It knows like no other the importance and value of using the right diacritics and the difference between cedilla, ogonek and and the way things should be. For all its versatility, Onest allows text to keep its individuality. All thanks to alternative symbols that set the tone and even the character of the message.
